Introduction

Apart from its function as target material and heat transfer medium, the liquid metal in a liquid metal spallation target acts as a solvent and reaction medium for nuclear reaction products, such as Polonium, Mercury and others. 

Focusing on impurities in liquid metal spallation targets and nuclear reactors seems to be a crucial step to take for several significant reasons. The typical amounts and concentrations of impurities that are to be expected for different facilities, according to predictions using nuclear codes, vary substantially, from several grams for the MEGAPIE project, to kilograms for an LBE-based European Spallation Source.

The most important physicochemical process involving impurities generated by irradiation in a liquid metal target or reactor pool is the volatilization of radioactive species. These processes play a dominant role in the assessment of radioactivity release both under normal operation and in accident scenarios. Initially, these products exist in atomically dispersed form until they reach a certain saturation concentration and react to form compounds. When a species is at a particular degree of dilution in a particular solvent (here lead or LBE) the dilution and any chemical interaction with the solvent will also change the thermodynamical activity of the species and thus the thermodynamic state of the medium. Knowing solubility behavior is crucial for safe operation, but having complete thermodynamic data for all possible species and phases remains challenging due to the complexity of the system.

The risks associated with radioactive contamination, the formation of insoluble compounds, and the volatilization of certain elements, such as mercury, are critical for the safety of nuclear facilities. Experiments show that the mercury concentration in the gas above LBE can be significant, especially at high temperatures, highlighting the importance of monitoring and managing these impurities.

In this context, the study begins by assuming a closed system; i-e a system with conservation of mass, energy, and based, more particularly, on equilibrium conditions for vapour pressures; and the main aim is to estimate the maximum gas-phase concentrations of radionuclides in the cover gas (of liquid metal targets and reactor systems) based on equilibrium of vapor pressures. With this data and some properties of the target or reactor system, it is possible to calculate what fractions and amounts of the radioisotopes will be found in gas phase and in the liquid metal, respectively. 

The study will be further completed by generalizing to open systems; i-e a system under non-equilibrium conditions; through approximations related to evaporation in infinite volumes, for example in a case of a breach to the exterior (loss of cover gas pressure or a liquid metal spill) where non-equilibrium conditions apply and net transport of vapour from the liquid metal to the atmosphere takes place.


   
As a reminder, Henry's law is :

.. math::
   P_A = P_A \degree \gamma_A . X_A
   :label: henry_law

or, in an other form :

.. math::
   P_A = K_{H,A} . X_A
   :label: henry_law2

with:

.. math:: 
   \begin{aligned}
   & \text{$P_A$ the vapour pressure of component A.}\\
   & \text{$P_A \degree$ the vapour pressure of pure component A.}\\
   & \text{$X_A$ the molar fraction of component A in solution.}\\
   & \text{$\gamma_A$ the activity coefficient of component A.}\\
   & \text{$K_{H,A}$ Henry constant.}
   \end{aligned}


In order to estimate the contamination, the study uses equivalents of Henry's Law, supposing an ideal solution and very low pressure, and will be interested in approximating vapour partial pressure, activity coefficient, Henry's constant or, in the second part of the study, evaporation rate.

This chapter also introduces uncertainties. Our work will then focus on how to implement this improvment in our package.
