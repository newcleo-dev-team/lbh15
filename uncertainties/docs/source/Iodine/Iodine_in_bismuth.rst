Iodine in bismuth

The folllowing equation is considered to be a fairly good estimation of the iodine content in the vapours over iodine-contaminated liquid bismuth. This is in all likelihood a gross overestimation of the actual vapour pressure over a dilute solution, between 682 and 812 K :cite:`book4`:
