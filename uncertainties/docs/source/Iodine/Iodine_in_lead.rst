==============
Iodine in lead
==============

One can use the first equation below 697 K :cite:`book11` and the second one above 697 K :cite:`book10` as Henry constants for calculating the total iodine levels, expressed as gaseous PbI2, over contaminated liquid lead.

The first equation is:

.. math:: 
   P_{PbI_{2}} \degree = 10^{-\frac{8691 \pm 84}{T} + 13.814 \pm 0.140}
   :label: p_pbi

and the second one:

.. math:: 
   P_{PbI_{2}} \degree = 10^{-\frac{9087}{T} + 31.897 - 6.16\log{T}}
   :label: p_pbi2
