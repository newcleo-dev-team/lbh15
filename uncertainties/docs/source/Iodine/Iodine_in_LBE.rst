=============
Iodine in LBE
=============
 
The retention of iodine in LBE is caused mainly by its chemical interaction with lead. The partial pressure of iodine could be estimated either with :cite:`book18` :cite:`book19`:

.. math:: 
   K_{H(I,LBE)} = 10^{-\frac{10407}{T} + 14.56}
   :label: k_i_lbe

or more conservatively, by the function for the vapour pressure of pure $PbI_{2}$ combined with its molar fraction in the melt, thus using the equations of $PbI_{2}$ as Henry constants. Using the molar fraction of monoatomic iodine, being twice that of the postulated PbI2, with the latter functions results in a value twice the partial pressure of actual $PbI_{2}$. The study recommends using this equations multiplied by two times the molar fraction of $PbI_{2}$, as a hypothetical but practical “$Pb_{0.5 }I$” partial pressure. Thus the concentration in the liquid metal and the calculated content in the gas phase will conveniently be expressed on monoatomic iodine basis.
