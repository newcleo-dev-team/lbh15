Rubidium in LBE
===============

Rubidium is very similar in its chemical behaviour to its higher homologue caesium. Therefore, it can certainly be expected to be retained in lead alloys in an analogous way. According to :cite:`book12` the vapour pressure of metallic rubidium can be described using the following equation:

.. math:: 
   P_{Rb} \degree = 10^{-\frac{4588}{T} - 1.45\log{T} + 14.110}
   :label: p_rb

with:

.. math:: 
   \log{\gamma_{Rb(LBE)}} = -1.7
