=================================
Thallium in lead, bismuth and LBE
=================================

There is no strong chemical interaction between Pb and Tl to be expected that could cause a chemical retention. The Bi-Tl system shows quite complicated behaviour, with multiple eutectic points and indications for intermetallic phase formation at intermediate to high Tl content and low temperatures. A certain degree of retention of Tl release from bismuth is thus to be expected.

Consequently, a retention of the release of Tl from LBE, primarily due to its interaction with bismuth, is to be noticed. However, since it is not possible to accurately predict its behaviour in LBE and because of uncertainties with respect to the temperature dependence of its activity coefficient, the study recommends using the larger of the two values for the Tl activity coefficient determined for the binary mixtures, i.e. the one for Tl in Pb for conservative estimations of its vapour pressure over LBE, hence :cite:`book7` :cite:`book13`:

.. math:: 
   \gamma_{Tl(Pb)} = 0.8

resulting in:

.. math:: 
   K_{H(Tl,LBE)} = 10^{-\frac{9463}{T} + 13.264 - 0.892\log{T}}
