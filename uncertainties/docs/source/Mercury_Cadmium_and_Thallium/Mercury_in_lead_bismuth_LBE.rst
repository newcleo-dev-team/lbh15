================================
Mercury in lead, bismuth and LBE
================================

Because of the weak interaction of mercury with both solvent metals, no compound formation is expected in the gas phase. It is expected that the formation of mercury compounds will neither lead to a strong retention in the condensed phase nor contribute significantly to the mercury partial pressure observed above the liquid metal.

Qualitatively, the results of the experiments show that significant amounts of mercury begin to evaporate from liquid LBE at temperatures starting from about 475 K, so that the possibility of mercury release has to be seriously considered in safety assessments only for lead-alloy-based spallation targets. The study uses the following relation :cite:`book13`:


.. math:: 
   K_{H(Hg,LBE)} = 10^{-\frac{3332.7}{T} + 12.6706 - 0.848 \log{T}}
   :label: k_hg_lbe

with:

.. math:: 
   \log\gamma_{Hg(LBE)}<0.3
   :label: gamma_hg
