================================
Cadmium in lead, bismuth and LBE
================================

There is no strong attractive interactions between Cd and the solvent metals and, hence, no retention effects are expected for Cd in liquid Pb, Bi and LBE.

Nevertheless, the work of Landolt-Bornstein in 1991 shows that Cd tends to react sufficiently with Pb,leading to an increase of vapour pressure compared to that expected for an ideal solution. Furthermore, it is desirable to verify the statements made above with experimental studies of the ternary Cd-Pb-Bi system. In any case, with a gamma of : 


.. math:: 
   \gamma_{Cd(LBE)} = 4

we tend to use :cite:`book13`:

.. math:: 
   K_{H(Cd,LBE)} = 10^{-\frac{5711}{T} + 14.38 - 1.0867\log{T}}
   :label: h_cd_lbe
