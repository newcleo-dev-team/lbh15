The aim is to develop methods for estimating maximum evaporation rates using equilibrium evaporation data. 
If the rate of evaporation of the liquid observed is higher than theoretical, then there is a possibility of contamination. The contaminating species may have changed the physico-chemical properties of the liquid.
The maximum rate of evaporation of a pure substance is :cite:`book15`:

.. math:: 
   R_{m(A)} = \sqrt{\frac{M}{2\pi RT}} K_{H,A(Pb,LBE)} X_{A(Pb,LBE)}
   :label: rate_evap

with:

.. math::
   \begin{aligned}
   & \text{$K_{H,A(Pb,LBE)}$ Henry constant of the element A in Pb or LBE solution}\\
   & \text{$X_{A(Pb,LBE)}$ mole fraction of the dissolved element A.}  
   \end{aligned}

The molar evaporation rate can then be simply calculated by dividing the evaporation rate by the molar mass of the evaporated species:

.. math:: 
   R_{n(A)} = R_{m(A)}/M

For the effective vapour pressure of the most important volatile species formed by nuclear reactions within a lead-alloy-based spallation target, i.e. Po, Hg, Cd, Tl, I and Cs, the relations from part 2 can be used. Evaporation rates can then be calculated using the maximum rate of evaporation formula.
This formula together with the relations for effective vapour pressure can be used for simple and extremely conservative estimations of the maximum possible rates of evaporation of volatiles from a liquid metal surface for cases where no experimental data are available, which is the case for most of the volatile elements discussed in the study.
