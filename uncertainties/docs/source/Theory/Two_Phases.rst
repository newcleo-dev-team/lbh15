==========
Two Phases
==========

In two-phase systems a transfer of material from one phase to the other takes place when there is a difference in the chemical potential of the component of interest across the phase boundary. In the case studied here, radionuclides dissolved in dilute solution in a liquid metal will be transferred to the gas phase, the driving force being the difference in chemical potential of the considered radionuclide in the liquid and in the gas phase.
The chemical potential of the radionuclide in the gas phase is given by its thermodynamic activity in the gas phase, which can be expressed by its partial pressure in case of ideal behaviour.
Generally, in the theory of mass transfer, the molar mass flux can be expressed in the form of the simple equation :cite:`book15`:

.. math:: 
   R_{n(A)} = k \Delta{a_{A}}
   :label: rate_evap_n2

with:

.. math::
   \begin{aligned}
   & \text{$R_{n}$ molar mass flux (corresponding to the evaporation rate)}\\
   & \text{$k$ the mass transfer coefficient}
   \end{aligned}

.. math::
    \Delta{a_{A}} \text{difference in the thermodynamic activity of element A between liquid and gaseous phase}


The determination of the mass transfer coefficient is extremely complex and dependent on the experimental boundary conditions of the phenomenon to be studied
