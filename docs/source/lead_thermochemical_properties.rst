lbh15.properties.lead_thermochemical_properties module
======================================================
In this section of the lbh15 package there is the documentation 
of lead properties objects, i.e., the classes that actually 
implements lead thermochemical property correlations. They 
are then dynamically added to :class:`.Lead`.
