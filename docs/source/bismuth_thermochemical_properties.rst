lbh15.properties.bismuth_thermochemical_properties module
=========================================================
In this section of the lbh15 package there is the documentation 
of bismuth properties objects, i.e., the classes that actually 
implements bismuth thermochemical property correlations. They 
are then dynamically added to :class:`.Bismuth`.
