Introduction
------------

*lbh15* (**L**\ ead **B**\ ismuth **H**\ andbook 20\ **15**) is a Python package that implements the
thermo-physical and the thermo-chemical properties of lead, bismuth and lead-bismuth eutectic (lbe) metal alloy available from
the handbook edited by 
`OECD/NEA <https://www.oecd-nea.org/jcms/pl_14972/handbook-on-lead-bismuth-eutectic-alloy-and-lead-properties-materials-compatibility-thermal-hydraulics-and-technologies-2015-edition?details=true>`_.

*lbh15* offers a standard implementation for use of these properties in scientific applications.
In particular, this package is used for numerical simulation and experimental activities supporting the
development of nuclear reactors that employ heavy liquid metals as primary coolant.

*lbh15* is developed by the **Codes & Methods** group of `newcleo <https://www.newcleo.com/>`_ and it is released under the **GNU Lesser General Public License 3**.

*lbh15* is listed among the Open-source Nuclear Codes for Reactor Analysis (`ONCORE <https://nucleus.iaea.org/sites/oncore/SitePages/List%20of%20Codes.aspx>`_) by IAEA.

Project Structure
-----------------

The project is organized according to the following folder structure:

.. code:: text

  <lbh15 parent folder>
    ├── docs/
    ├── lbh15/
    ├── tests/
    ├── tutorials/
    ├── CHANGELOG.rst
    ├── LICENSE
    ├── MANIFEST.in
    ├── README.rst
    ├── pyproject.toml
    └── setup.py
    

- ``lbh15``: contains all modules, classes and methods implemented in *lbh15*;
- ``docs``: contains files for the generation of the documentation by Sphinx;
- ``tests``: collection of tests used to verify the correct implementation;
- ``tutorials``: collection of tutorials and examples, each one into a dedicated sub-folder.

Dependencies
------------

To run the code, the following dependencies must be satisfied:

- ``Python`` :math:`>= 3.8.10`
- ``SciPy`` :math:`>= 1.8.1`
- ``NumPy`` :math:`>= 1.22.3`

To build the documentation in both *html* and *LaTeX* formats, the following dependencies must be satisfied:

- ``sphinx`` :math:`>= 6.2.1`
- ``sphinx-rtd-theme`` :math:`>= 1.3.0`
- ``myst-parser`` :math:`>= 1.0.0`
- ``sphinxcontrib-bibtex`` :math:`>= 2.5.0`

Installation
------------

To install the *lbh15* package, please type the following command:

  .. code-block:: bash

      pip install lbh15

Or use https://github.com/newcleo-dev-team/lbh15.git to clone the package.
After cloning the package, execute the following command inside the base folder:

  .. code-block:: bash

      pip install .

To upgrade the *lbh15* package, please type the ``install`` command along with the ``--upgrade`` or ``-U`` flag:

  .. code-block:: bash

      pip install --upgrade lbh15

Documentation
-------------

The Sphinx documentation can be built in *html* and *LaTeX* formats by executing
the following command in the folder ``docs/``:

  .. code-block:: bash

      make html

  .. code-block:: bash

      make latexpdf

The *html* documentation is available on GitHub Pages at `newcleo-dev-team.github.io/lbh15 <https://newcleo-dev-team.github.io/lbh15/index.html>`_.

To see the available templates for generating the documentation in *PDF* format and to choose among them, please
look at the ``docs/conf.py`` file.
